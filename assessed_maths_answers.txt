Task 1:
Q1: Where is the key card in the room (coordinates, disregard decimals)? Justify answer with code and figures.

### Answer to Q1:
The key card is located at the mean point of all movements. The coordinates of the key card are approximately (0, 0).

### Code:
import math
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def hidden_card():
    zposition_list = []
    a = 13  # Define the variable 'a'

    # zinitial initial position of the hidden card
    zinitial = (1 + 1j) / (math.sqrt(2) * (1j**4) * (((1 + 1j) / abs(1 + 1j))**a))

    # u is next position of the hidden card
    u = math.sqrt(2) / (1 + 1j)

    # move position by dividing her current position by u
    zposition = zinitial / u
    zposition_list.append(zposition)

    # creates a plot of the hidden card's position
    plt.xlim(-1, 1)
    plt.ylim(-1, 1)
    plt.xlabel("Real")
    plt.ylabel("Imaginary")
    
    # dl moves 64 times until she notices the card in the mean of all 64 times moved
    for i in range(64):
        zposition = zposition / u
        zposition_list.append(zposition)
        plt.plot(zposition.real, zposition.imag, 'ro')
    
    # the mean of all 64 times moved
    zmean = np.mean(zposition_list)
    plt.plot(zmean.real, zmean.imag, 'bo')
    plt.grid()
    plt.show()
    return zmean

hidden_card()


Q2: Explain why ideally using maths.

### Answer to Q2:
Using mathematics, we can explain that the key card is located at the mean point of all movements because DI irrational moves in a deterministic pattern. 
Each movement is a division by a complex number, which results in a predictable trajectory. 
By averaging all the positions, we find the central point of this trajectory, which is the mean of all positions. 
This mean point is where the key card is located.

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Position Calculation**:
   - Zinitial = (i+j) / x j**4 ((1+j)/ )**a
   - This formula calculates the initial position of DI irrational in the room.

2. **Next Position Calculation**:
   - U = ( )/(1+j)2
   - DI irrational moves by dividing her current position by "u".

3. **Loop for 64 Moves**:
   - DI irrational moves 64 times, updating her position each time by dividing by "u"

4. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The mean of all positions is calculated to find the central point of the trajectory.

5. **Plotting**:
   - The positions are plotted on a graph, with the mean position highlighted.

By following this deterministic pattern, we can accurately determine the location of the key card in the room.
we get # np.complex128(-0.01087856586440844-0.01087856586440844j)



Task 2:
Q3: Where is the key card in the second room (coordinates, disregard decimals)? Justify answer with code and figures.

def second_room(zmean):
    a = 13
    count = 0
    zposition_list2 = []
    
    # zinitial initial position of the hidden card
    zinitial = (math.sqrt(2)*(1 + 1j)) / (((1+1j)/math.sqrt(2))**a)

    # u is next position of the hidden card
    u = math.sqrt(2) / (1 + 1j)

    # move positions by dividing her current position by u
    zposition = zinitial / u

    # dl moves up to 64 times. but quicker than the first room as it stops if the card is found in the mean of all 64 times moved
    while count < 64:
        zposition = zposition / u
        zposition_list2.append(zposition)
        zpositionmean2 = np.mean(zposition_list2)
        if np.isclose(zpositionmean2, zmean, atol=1e-6):
            break
        count += 1
        plt.plot(zposition.real, zposition.imag, 'ro')
        plt.xlabel('real')
        plt.ylabel('imaginary')

    # the mean of all 64 times moved
    zpositionmean2 = np.mean(zposition_list2)
    plt.plot(zpositionmean2.real, zpositionmean2.imag, 'bo')
    plt.grid()
    plt.show()
    print(f"count: {count}")
    print(f"zpositionmean2: {zpositionmean2}")
    print(f"zmean: {zmean}")
    return zmean

zmean = hidden_card()  # Assuming hidden_card() is defined as in Task 1
second_room(zmean)

count: 7 steps
task2 mean : 0j
task1 mean : (-0.01087856586440844-0.01087856586440844j)

Q4: Explain why ideally using maths.

### Answer to Q4:
Using mathematics, we can explain that the key card is located at the mean point of all movements because DI irrational moves in a deterministic pattern. 
Each movement is a division by a complex number, which results in a predictable trajectory. 
By averaging all the positions, we find the central point of this trajectory, which is the mean of all positions. 
This mean point is where the key card is located and we can count how long i takes to get there

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Position Calculation**:
   - zinitial = (math.sqrt(2)*(1 + 1j)) / (((1+1j)/math.sqrt(2))**a)
   - This formula calculates the initial position of DI irrational in the room.

2. **Next Position Calculation**:
   - u = math.sqrt(2) / (1 + 1j)
   - DI irrational moves by dividing her current position by "u"

3. **Loop for Moves**:
   - DI irrational moves up to 64 times, updating her position each time by dividing by u
   - The loop breaks if the mean position task1 is close to task2 within a tolerance of  1e-6.
   - printing the counted loops

4. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The mean of all positions is calculated to find the central point of the trajectory.

5. **Plotting**:
   - The positions are plotted on a graph, with the mean position highlighted.

By following this deterministic pattern, we can accurately determine the location of the key card in the room.

Task3:

Since both num and den are real-valued for the given range of x, the resulting y will also be real-valued. 
However, there might be points where the denominator den is zero, 
which would result in division by zero and thus y would be infinity at those points.

To summarize, y is a real-valued array, but it may contain infinity values where the denominator is zero.

So yes pick option [A] as it is a real number most of the time.
