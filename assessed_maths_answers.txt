Task3:

Since both num and den are real-valued for the given range of x, the resulting y will also be real-valued. 
However, there might be points where the denominator den is zero, 
which would result in division by zero and thus y would be infinity at those points.

To summarize, y is a real-valued array, but it may contain infinity values where the denominator is zero.

So yes pick option [A] as it is a real number most of the time.
